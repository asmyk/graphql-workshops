# Tasks

I've prepared starters for you with some boilerplate code. You can also use starters from official apollo's github, but this ones are crafted for our workshops. Let's get familiar with those tools. 

1. **Download & run Apollo server starter:** [**https://github.com/asmyk-zendesk/graphql-workshops-starters/tree/master/server**](https://github.com/asmyk-zendesk/graphql-workshops-starters/tree/master/server)\*\*\*\*
2. **Download & run Apollo client starter:** [**https://github.com/asmyk-zendesk/graphql-workshops-starters/tree/master/client**](https://github.com/asmyk-zendesk/graphql-workshops-starters/tree/master/client)\*\*\*\*
